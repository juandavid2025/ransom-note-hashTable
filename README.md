## Project Files
The solution was made in a Java project where you can find, inside of src folder, two classes Main.java and RansomNote.java in their respective folders named the same in lower case.

The purpose RansomNote.java class is to contain all the logic and atributes to solve the problem with a very simple selfmade hasgTable.

Main. java will create an instance of RansomNote, create some test data and run isNoteInMagazine() for each test.
